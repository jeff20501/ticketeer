## Overview

I created a Conference Ticket Generator web app as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. The goal was to build an interactive form that allows users to input their details, upload an avatar image (with validation), and generate a personalized digital ticket for an upcoming coding conference.

### The challenge

1. File Size Validation

Initially, uploaded images over 500KB were accepted, which broke the design. I learned how to:

Display an appropriate error and prevent preview:
```js
  if (file.size > maxSize) {
      info.innerHTML = "File too large Upload under 500KB."
      return false
  }
```

Limit file size using byte calculation:
500KB = 500 * 1024 bytes

2. Displaying Text Over Image
When overlaying user data on the ticket background, positioning was tricky. I had to:

Use position: absolute for layered text.

Learn how to align elements over background images cleanly.

3. Gradient Text Styling
I used a gradient on the user name using CSS:

```css
.user-name{
  background: linear-gradient(to right, hsl(7, 86%, 67%), hsl(0, 0%, 100%));
  background-clip: text;
color: transparent;
}
```

4. Form Validation Logic
Implementing real-time validation for:

- Empty name
- Invalid email
- Empty GitHub username



I learned to improve the user experience by:

Allowing users to remove or change uploaded images.

Preventing accidental double-event firing using ```stopPropagation()```

## My process

### Built with

HTML5 â€“ for semantic and accessible structure.

CSS3 â€“ used extensively for layout, design, and visual effects (including gradient text).

JavaScript (Vanilla) â€“ used for form validation, file handling, DOM manipulation, and localStorage.

### What I learned

```FileReader``` API â€“ to convert uploaded image to a Base64 string for easy rendering.

```localStorage``` â€“ for passing user data between form page and ticket page.

```nextElementSibling``` â€“ for dynamically appending error messages under inputs.

```Event handling``` â€“ for image uploading, removal, and real-time validation.

CSS ```backdrop-filter``` â€“ to create frosted-glass effects.

Responsive design & modern layout techniques (```flex``, center alignment, etc.)

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
